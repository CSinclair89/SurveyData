# Income Survey and Publishing Data Report

This is a breakdown of the data gathered from the GSS survey on the increase of income per year as well as the payment of various publishing deals.

Full report can be found at the following link: http://chrisso.tv/pdf/GSS_Survey_PublishingReport.pdf

## Goals

- Use Python to clean data fields into proper data types for aggregation and visualization.
- Run ADF tests to determine stationarity of income/year.
- Run a linear regression to forecast future income trend per year, based on provided data.
- Run a correlation coefficient on difference in publishing deal payments between white authors and black authors.

## Outcomes  

This report was a fun one to put together because it involved all of the major aspects of data, specifically the processes of cleaning, optimizing, aggregating, and visualizing data. To have real-world data that wasn't already optimized meant that I had to configure it in a way that I could make something presentable out of it. Ultimately, I was able to extract a surprising amount of information with the data given as well as learn a lot about the full process from start to finish.
